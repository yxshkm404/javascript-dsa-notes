## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This resource covers everything you need to excel in technical interviews and become a better problem solver:

### 📚 Core Topics

**Basics**  
Start with the fundamentals: asymptotic notations, variables, functions, loops, methods, and object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

**Data Structures**  
Learn how to implement and use essential data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps, sets, and more.

**Algorithms**  
Master key algorithmic techniques: sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and problem-solving patterns.

**Practice Problems**  
Challenge yourself with curated coding problems organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) to reinforce your learning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to DSA, we recommend following this learning path:

1. **Start with [Basics](Basics/Asymptotic-Notations.md)** — Understand time and space complexity
2. **Learn [Data Structures](Data-Structures/arrays.md)** — Begin with arrays and progress to complex structures
3. **Study [Algorithms](Algorithms/sorting.md)** — Master sorting and searching first
4. **Practice Regularly** — Solve problems from the [Practice section](Practice/easy.md)

## 💡 Why JavaScript for DSA?

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, widely used in web development. Learning DSA in JavaScript offers several advantages:

✅ **Universal Language** — Used in frontend, backend, and full-stack development  
✅ **Interview Ready** — Many companies accept JavaScript for technical interviews  
✅ **Rich Ecosystem** — Built-in methods and data structures make implementation easier  
✅ **Practical Application** — Apply DSA concepts directly to real-world projects

## 📖 How to Use This Documentation

**For Beginners:**  
Follow the structured path from Basics → Data Structures → Algorithms → Practice. Take your time to understand each concept before moving forward.

**For Interview Prep:**  
Focus on the most commonly asked data structures (arrays, strings, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming). Practice problems daily.

**For Quick Reference:**  
Use the search functionality (press `S` or `/`) to quickly find specific topics, methods, or implementations.

## 🎓 Learning Tips

**Consistency is Key**  
Dedicate 30-60 minutes daily to learning DSA. Regular practice is more effective than cramming.

**Understand, Don't Memorize**  
Focus on understanding the "why" behind each algorithm and data structure, not just the "how."

**Practice Different Problems**  
Solve a variety of problems to recognize patterns and improve problem-solving skills.

**Code by Hand First**  
Try solving problems on paper before jumping to the IDE. This helps in interviews.

**Learn from Mistakes**  
Review solutions and learn optimal approaches. Understanding better solutions improves your thinking.
